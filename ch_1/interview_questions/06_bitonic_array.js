/* Search in a bitonic array
 * An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately
 * by a decreasing sequence of integers.
 * Write a program that, given a bitonic array of N distinct integer values, 
 * determines whether a given integer is in the array. 
 * 
 * * Standard version - Use ~ 3lgN compares in the worst case 
 * * Signing bonus - USe ~2lgN compares in the worst case ( and prove that no algorithm
 * can guarantee to perform fewer than ~2lgN compares in the worst case)
